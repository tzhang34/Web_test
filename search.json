    "text": "Poster Symposium Activity\nI was fortunate to be able to see the poster presentation from Philip Gibbs, a second year physics graduate student currently working in Dr.Ojeda’s group. His poster is on the topic of “Exploring quantum spin liquid excitation in a kitaev material through photo excitation of carriers”.\nIn their previous work on the transport measurement of RuCl_3 low dimension material in 7-40 kelvin temperature region. He briefly went over their sample preparation process which includes mechanical exfoliation of RuCl_3 on SiO_2 substrate and electron beam lithography. One question comes to my mind is how is the transport properties measured on such a small flake. I have heard of the 4 point probe measurement in measuring the conductivity of recently popular room-temperature superconductor (LK- 99). But it turns out Dr.Ojeda’s group is using tri-axial line method which reduces the leakage of current during the measuring process.\n\n\n\nThis image is taken in Dr.Ojeda’s lab, on Thursday 09/19/2024. Second year graduate student Richard Gibbs were going through his poster for Friday’s symposium."
